- Build GameCommandBuilder for testing purposes (with standard variant by default) - create and fill game
    default for standard variant
- Try diplicity games for orders (try it in cli)
- Implement Adjudicator for testing purposes which also caches the responses and therefore can be used for testing (maybe use __FUNCTION__ for context)
- Implement the rest (like make game full, etc.)


- Make designated game info dto game queries (based on https://webdiplomacy.net/board.php?gameID=63723#gamePanel)
    - name
    - variantId
    - current phase name (string, like Winter 2023)
    - current phase type (enum: movement, retreat, adjustment)
    - anonymous yes/no
    - state
    - phase length
    - timestamp
    - game end state
    - winner

    - variant power data:
        - name
        - playerId
        - num-centers
        - num-units
        - status (enum: won, survived, drawn, defeated)
